# Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting with the recozik project is expected to:

- Be respectful, inclusive, and patient in all communications.
- Provide constructive feedback and focus on the work, not the person.
- Assume good intent but acknowledge impact when harm occurs.
- Accept guidance from maintainers regarding scope, tone, and priorities.

Unacceptable behaviour includes harassment, discrimination, personal attacks, and disruptive trolling. Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including removing comments, revoking access, or banning contributors.

Incidents can be reported confidentially at `security@zajda.fr`. Reports should include a description of the behaviour, when it occurred, and any context that may help us respond.

Maintainers will review reports promptly, keep them as confidential as possible, and communicate follow-up actions to the reporter.
