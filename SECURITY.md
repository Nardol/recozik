# Security Policy

## Supported versions
recozik is currently pre-release software. Security fixes are provided on a best-effort basis for the latest tagged version and the `main` branch.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please email `patrick@zajda.fr` with the following details:
- A description of the issue and its impact.
- Steps to reproduce or proof of concept if available.
- Any suggested mitigations.

We aim to acknowledge new reports within five business days. After initial triage we will coordinate on a remediation plan, publish an advisory if required, and credit you (with permission) in release notes.

Avoid filing security issues on public trackers or discussion boards. If you need to encrypt your report, request our PGP fingerprint in your initial email.
